Post: The missile is no longer active.

1e. The solution must maintain the same constant speed for all missiles
Pre: Game is running with no active missiles
Action: Rapidly click right mouse or space bar 5 times, all in the same direction. Observe if missiles run into one another.
Post: No missiles hit each other

1f. The solution must launch missiles from the center of the screen when a launch is initiated
Pre: Game is running and no active missiles
Action: Press space bar or right-click
Post: Missile comes from the center of the bottom of the screen

1g. The solution must maintain the same constant direction for all missiles to be vertically straight up from the launched position
Pre: Game in running with no active missiles
Action: Launch a missile. Observe direction
Post: Missile came straight up from the bottom

1h. The solution must detect when a missile “hits” a ship
Precondition: There is a live ship
Action: The position of a missile overlaps with the position of a ship
Postcondition: The program accounts for the collision
 
1i. The solution must display an explosion at the point where a missile “hits” a ship
Precondition: There is a live ship
Action: a missile “hits” a ship
Postcondition: The solution displays an explosion
 
1j. The solution must remove the missile and ship after the missile “hits” the ship
Precondition: There is a live ship
Action: a missile “hits” a ship
Postcondition: The missile and ship are removed
 
1k. The solution must keep a count of all “hits”
Precondition: The counter is equal to the number of ships “hit”
Action: A ship is “hit”
Postcondition: The counter is incremented by 1

2a. The solution must initiate a ship launch when the system detects there are no active ships

2c. The solution must display the appropriate image based on the type of ship when the ship is active
Pre: Game is running
Action: Ships are active that have a type
Post: Image(s) are displayed
 
2d. The solution must randomly initiate a ship launch based on a configurable rate where the default is 30% of the time
Pre: Game is running
Action: Have a configurable rate that defaults to 30% of the time
Post: Randomly initiate a ship launch
 
2di. The solution must randomly choose from available ship types when a launch is initiated, giving all types equal chance of being launched
Pre: Game is running
Action: Launch is initiated, and have available ship types
Post: Deploy ships from available ship types
 
2dii. The solution must limit the number of active ships on the screen to no more than ten (10) at any given time. (an “active ship” is any ship currently being displayed on the screen)
Pre: Game is running with active ships
Action: 10 or less active ships on screen
Post: Make sure that they stay 10 or less

2diii. The solution must randomly choose a location to launch a ship from when initiated

Postcondition. The solution knows where to launch the ship
 
2diii1. The system must randomly choose to launch the ship from the left side of the screen or the right side of the screen
Precondition: The solution is firing a ship
Action: The solution randomly chooses from the available ship types
Postcondition: The solution knows which ship to launch
 
2diii2. The system must limit the number of active ships on the screen to no more than ten (10) at any given time. (an “active ship” is any ship currently being displayed on the screen)
Precondition: The solution is firing a ship
Action: The solution checks if there are 10 or more ships
Postcondition: The solution will not fire the ship if there are 10 or more ships
 
2diii3. The system must assign the speed of the ship based on the type of the ship being initiated
Precondition: The solution is firing a ship
Action: The solution randomly chooses the speed of the ship
Postcondition: The solution knows how fast the ship will launch
 
2diii4. The system must assign the direction of the ship based on which side of the screen it is being launched from (if from the left, direction goes left to right; if from the right, direction goes left to right; if from the right, direction goes right to left)
Precondition: The solution is firing a ship
Action: The solution decides to fire right if the ship is on the left, the solution decides to fire left if the ship is on the right
